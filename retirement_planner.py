"""Retirement planner derived from the provided Excel model.

This is a faithful-as-possible conversion using the exposed sheet columns.
Key simplifying assumptions where the spreadsheet logic wasn't 100% explicit:

- RMDs use the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table (2023+) with first RMD at age 73.
- AGI = other_income + SSA (taxable portion proxy) + Roth conversions
    + extra Traditional IRA dists + RMD.
- Taxable income = max(AGI - standard_deduction - senior_deduction, 0).
- IRMAA is computed from MAGIâ‰ˆAGI using the supplied brackets.
- Living expenses inflate annually.
- If net income (AGI - taxes - IRMAA) is less than living expenses, the gap is pulled from Roth.
- Traditional IRA balance evolves by: grow at investment_return, then subtract RMD, Roth conversion,
    and extra distributions.
- Roth IRA balance evolves by: grow at investment_return, add Roth conversion, then subtract any
    withdrawal to meet expenses.
- SSA benefit inflates annually; "factor_to_adjust_ssa" (from constants) can optionally scale it if
    desired.

The code is structured so you can replace any assumption with your own logic.
